## ‚öôÔ∏è How The System Works

This project uses a **classic client-server architecture**.

### The Server (`server.js`)
1. Serves all the static files (HTML, music files, etc.) located in the `public` folder.  
2. Creates an API endpoint at `/api/save-message` ‚Äî a dedicated mailbox waiting to receive messages.

### The Client (`phase4.html`)
- When a user types a message and clicks **"Send"**, the JavaScript on this page sends a **POST request** to the server's `/api/save-message` endpoint.

### The Log
- The server receives this request, takes the message, and prints it to the console using `console.log()`.  
- When deployed on a platform like Render, this console output becomes the server's permanent log file, securely storing every message received.

## üåê Deployment on Render

This project is designed to be deployed as a **Web Service** on Render.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
Ensure your project (with `server.js` and `package.json` in the root, and all HTML/media files in a `public` subfolder) is uploaded to a GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Create a New Web Service on Render

2. Click **New +** ‚Üí **Web Service**  
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository  
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: e.g., `my-birthday-surprise`  
   - **Runtime**: Node (auto-detected)  
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`  
   - **Start Command**: `node server.js`  
   - **Instance Type**: Free tier

### Step 3: Deploy

## üì© How to View Your Received Messages

Any messages submitted through the form on `phase4.html` will be printed to your server's logs.  
You can view them by going to the **Logs** tab for your Web Service on the Render dashboard.

## üß© Challenges Faced

- **Initial Idea**: Tried saving messages to `localStorage`, but that only saves data on the user's own browser.  
- **Third-Party Services**: Considered Formspree or serverless platforms like Vercel, but these broke the "self-contained" goal.  
- **The Solution**: A lightweight **Node.js/Express** server with a simple `/api/save-message` endpoint.  
  By logging the message with `console.log()` on the server, we created a free, simple, and effective "log file" system compatible with hosting platforms like Render.
